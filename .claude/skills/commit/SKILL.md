# Commit

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to see what changed.
2. Group related changes into one or more commits — don't bundle unrelated work.
3. Write commit messages that explain _why_, not _what_ (the diff already shows what).
4. Stage only the files relevant to this commit, then commit.

Never commit files that look like secrets (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*_credentials.json`) — warn instead of staging them.
